## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### 1. Location Accuracy  
- The accuracy of location tracking **depends on the device's GPS and network**.  
- On **Wi-Fi-only devices** or in areas with poor GPS signals, location data may be inaccurate.

---

### 2. Permission Denied  
- If the user **denies location access**, the tracking feature will not function.  
- The user must **allow location permissions** through the browser's settings to enable tracking.

---

### 3. Low Battery Impact
